## Learning Outcome
Students will learn to work on a complex project in a team setting. 

By implementing the project, the students will learn ...
* problem-solving skills, 
* self-management skills, 
* teamwork skills, and 
* the ability for independent scientific work. 
* methods and knowledge about the subject matter, by focus on practical experience.

This way, the students will be able to perform, plan, and lead similar projects in a professional context. 

## Inhalte

The project consists of supervised work on a complex task in research and development (possibly in cooperation with external partners), in a team. The supervisor defines the objectives of the project, and guides the team during the project execution. This includes a regular progress monitoring, in the form of intermediate meetings between supervisor and team in intervals 
of not more than three weeks.
 
In addition, the supervisor agrees at least two project milestones with the team. The milestone results will contribute in an adequate manner to the final grade. The supervisor further decides, in consent with the student team, about communication channels and the mode of cooperation within the team, and reflects this in regular intervals together with the
team.  

The supervisor sets the goals of the project. The students independently research the relevant literature, decide on technology, and work on a solution.

## Lehr- und Lernmethoden

The students work on documentation of the project results, research state of the art technology, use problem-solving methods etc. Teamwork is an essential part of the learning experience, therefore the minimum number of participants is 2 students.

The overall grade is based on the project results, project report, presentation, and possibly other parts (at the discretion of the individual lecturer).
