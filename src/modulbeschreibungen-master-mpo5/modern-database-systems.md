<!-- Learning Outcome -->

After a successful completion of this module, students are able to ...

* handle problems in the area of database systems independently, 

by
(for new database systems:)

* understanding the special opportunities and problems of when to store, analyse and tread Big Data efficiently, and  
* learning basic principles of NoSQL-Data models and –systems and other Big Data solutions, and
* knowing particular requirements of database systems in the context of mobile applications and the appropriate solution strategies, and
* appreciating the capabilities and difficulties of "in memory" database systems (DBS-RAM) as well as the cloud databases, and
* developing an understanding of the ethical borders of „Big Data“.

(for multimedia database systems:)

* developing an understanding of the special issues associated with storing and retrieving multimedia data, and
* getting to know the SQL2011 standard in this field and acquire practical skills to build text, image, video and sound databases.

so that they are able to develop comprehensive solutions while applying and deepening the theoretical knowledge.
