<!-- Learning Outcome -->

* After completing the course students can assess which data mining analytics are suitable for which application fields and apply them where suitable as they become able
    * to enumerate different data analytics approaches and outline how they work,
    * to identify the advantages and disadvantages of various data analytics techniques,
    * to implement common libraries of data analytics approaches,
* so that they help companies to become data driven, i.e. take decisions based on suitable data, optimize processes e.g. in business, production or logistics, and make predictions to better plan future actions and activities (e.g. where to invest for productivity increase or whom to approach in marketing).
