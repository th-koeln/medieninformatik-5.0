<!-- Learning Outcome -->

The importance of making scientific results available to the public can be explained and diverse, i.a. discipline-related contexts of the creation and management of research data can be analysed in a differentiating manner with regard to the procedures for processing and providing research data.

For this purpose, the students will work with case studies of research data, from which they generate discipline-specific support and information services for researchers and engage themselves with different tools related to Open Science to evaluate their features, come up with improvements, and to develop services around them. 

On this basis, the students can evaluate and apply existing and future services relating to open science and develop optimization suggestions for them.
