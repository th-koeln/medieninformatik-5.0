## {{ site.translations[site.lang].moduledescription.learning_outcome }}
<!-- Learning Outcome -->

* Enabling students to design and implement a Business Intelligence and Business Analytics infrastructure so as to support management decision
* by structuring customers‘ requirements, analyzing data source quality and identifying appropriate data structures and algorithms
* they will become able to design an appropriate infrastructure. They plan the staging of raw data to analytical data and assess the applicability of classical and modern techniques delivered by common BI/BA platforms.
* Based on these skills they will be able to build up an appropriate decision support infrastructure to improve decision processes and to maximize enterprise profits.
